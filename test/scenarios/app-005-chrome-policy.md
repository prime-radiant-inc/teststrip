# app-005-chrome-policy: the simplified chrome policy is live in the assembled UI

**What this covers**: Jesse lives in this chrome every session; the
simplification sweep must hold in the assembled window, not just in unit
tests. Inventory items 16-17: `WorkspaceChromePolicy` — the ten chrome
booleans are Library-only, and `showsInspector` is true for every workspace
except Cull (`WorkspaceChromePolicy`,
`Sources/TeststripApp/LibraryGridView.swift:7208-7268`; inspector gating in
`Sources/TeststripApp/main.swift:49-54`). Also the UX-simplification sweep (spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-08-teststrip-ux-simplification-proposal.md`) is
a legibility pass over working machinery — most of it only exists in the
assembled AppKit chrome, where unit tests and the headless gate can't see it.
This card drives the live window and asserts the new chrome is present and the
old jargon is gone: the marquee **Find Best Shots** action, the collapsed
**Import ▾** / **⋯ More** toolbar, the removal of the **Copilot** label, and
the absence of the three-Imports tangle. (There is no static "Review" sidebar
row — the sidebar's review-queue rows are named Picks/Likely Issues/etc. and
only render once their counts are non-zero; the sole surviving "Review"
control is the autopilot-proposals banner button, which appears only when a
proposal batch is pending.) It also exercises the core promise that Find Best
Shots never dead-ends the user on a bare "0 keepers".

## Pre-state
- Fresh build, seeded isolated catalog so the grid and sidebar render real rows:
  ```bash
  ./script/build_and_run.sh --smoke
  ISOLATED=$(/bin/ps eww -axo command= | awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){p="TESTSTRIP_APPLICATION_SUPPORT_DIRECTORY=";if(index($i,p)==1)print substr($i,length(p)+1)}}' | head -1)
  DB="$ISOLATED/Teststrip/catalog.sqlite"
  ```
- Keep the instance warm (drive shortly after launch; re-assert frontmost each
  poll — the `verify_people_clustering.sh` pattern). A long-idle instance parks
  its AX tree and this card will false-negative.

## Steps
1. **Confirm the app is vended.** `script/ax_drive.sh wait-vended Teststrip`.
2. **Run the chrome assertions.** `script/verify_ux_simplification_chrome.sh`
   drives `ax_drive.sh find` for each contract:
   - `Find Best Shots` (AXButton) is present.
   - The collapsed `Import` menu (AXButton) is present.
   - No top-level `Import Folder` **and** no top-level `Import Card` button
     remain (they moved under Import ▾).
   - No element anywhere still reads `Copilot`.
3. **Prove Find Best Shots lands on best shots, not a dead end.** AX-press
   `Find Best Shots`. `waitFor` the grid scope to change to a ranked view —
   the evaluation pass runs and the grid scopes down to a ranked set of
   photos (the "Potential Picks"/"Picks" breadcrumb literal is not currently
   rendered — naming drift, tracked separately — so do not gate the pass/fail
   on that exact string; assert instead that the scope count is non-zero and
   ranked, e.g. via `sqlite3` evaluation_signals growth), or (on a genuinely
   unrankable seed) the plain-language status
   `These look too distinct to auto-rank — rate a few to rank`. A bare
   `0 keepers` / `0 · 0` result is a **failure**.
4. **Cross-check the switcher de-dup.** The Library sub-view switcher exposes
   `Grid`, `Loupe`, `Timeline`, `Map` — assert `Search`, `Review`, `People`,
   `Places` are **not** switcher buttons (they live in the sidebar).
5. **Chrome policy per workspace (items 16-17).** Press ⌘2 (Library): assert
   the search token field, Import ▾, Find Best Shots, Export, and the footer
   are present. Press ⌘1 (Cull): assert *all* of those are absent, and that
   ⌘I does not open an inspector column inside Cull (per
   `AppModel.toggleInspector` it switches to Library first — after ⌘I the
   Library chrome should be what renders). Press ⌘3 (People): assert the
   browse chrome (search field, Import ▾, Export, footer) is absent but ⌘I
   can open the inspector (showsInspector is true for People).

## Expected
- Step 2: `verify_ux_simplification_chrome.sh` prints `PASS: …` and exits 0.
  **Fails if** any control is missing or the old jargon/three-Imports survive.
- Step 3: the app routes to a ranked queue or shows the plain-language line;
  the status/grid never shows a bare zero. Cross-check ground truth:
  ```bash
  sqlite3 "$DB" "SELECT count(*) FROM assets;"   # scope is non-empty; the
                                                 # route landed on real rows
  ```
- Step 4: exactly three switcher buttons; the five set-routes are absent from
  the switcher (present in the sidebar instead).
- Step 5: every Library-only control disappears in Cull and People, and the
  inspector rule holds (never in Cull; available in Library and People).
  **Fails if** any browse control leaks into Cull/People, or ⌘I opens an
  inspector while Cull is active.

## Fixture status
Runnable with the standard `--smoke` seed (24 synthetic photos) — no special
fixture required. The plain-language branch in Step 3 is exercised when the
seed produces no likely-picks; the ranked-queue branch when it does. Either
outcome passes as long as the result is legible and never a bare zero.

## Cleanup
```bash
./script/reset_isolated_test_data.sh --delete
```
Quit the launched instance.

## Sharp edges
- Views branch on `WorkspaceChromePolicy`, never on raw `Workspace` cases —
  if a step-5 assertion fails, cite which policy boolean disagrees with the
  rendered chrome (that is the regression, not the card).
- Step 3's full routing matrix (evaluate-then-route vs. picks vs.
  nothing-ranked) is app-011's job; here it is only a smoke check that the
  button never dead-ends.
- Activity (⇧⌘0 toolbar item) is global chrome and intentionally NOT gated by
  the policy — do not count its presence in Cull/People as a leak.
